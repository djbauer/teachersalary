# Teacher Salary Summarizer

This repository contains the .R files necessary to generate a Shiny tool designed to allow a user to explore the 2018-2019 teacher salaries for the La Cross, WI School District.

The tool was created as a project to complete the Coursera course "Developing Data Products".

A working example of the tool is available here:
